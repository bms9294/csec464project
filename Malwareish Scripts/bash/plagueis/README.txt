plagueis.sh is the original source code, change_passwd.sh is a base64 encoded
version of that. Both scripts therefore serve the same purpose of rewriting
the /etc/passwd file with the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise. For malicious
purposes, only the change_passwd.sh should be used since it is obfuscated and
therefore difficult to determine its intended purpose. Note that this will
destroy your /etc/passwd file so run at your own risk.
