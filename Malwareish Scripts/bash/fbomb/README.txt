fbomb.sh demonstrates a fork bomb in bash script. hdd_defrag.sh is the most 
simplified version of a fork bomb without any comments to make it more 
difficult to read and understand (although a simple search will tell you what
it is). hdd_defrag.sh is named as such in order to trick an uninformed user
into running it, crashing their system in the process. Run at your own risk.
